    <h1>5 THINGS I REMEMBER DURING MY CHILDHOOD:</h1>
</body>
<ul>
    <li>My mother used to love dressing me up whenever we go somewhere.</li>
    <li>I enjoy watching Finding Nemo even after how many rewatches.</li>
    <li>The office where my mom works at was my go-to place if classes finished early.</li>
    <li>My first allowance was in sixth grade since I always brought my snacks to school.</li>
    <li>Our family would always have spontaneous trips.</li>
 </ul>

    <h1>WHO WILL I BE AFTER 5 YEARS?</h1>
</body>
<p>
    The future is unclear, a mysterious one that can be changed without you even knowing it.
    "Who am I in five years?", the question that haas been lingering on my mind until now.
    To be honest, I am not sure, clueless, but I am still looking forward to it. Five years
    from now, I want myself to be someone my family can be proud of with the achievements I 
    have fulfilled. In five years, I can be capable enough to take care of my mother and give
    her all the finer things she couldn't get. I would be able to find a workplace that I can
    be comfortable to work at. My friends I used to be with in school would want to meet me to
    spend time with and talk about the things we kept through the years that we didn't see each
    other. Five years is a long time for me to imagine what kind of person I am. One thing I
    know for sure though is that I will be someone who has learned a lot while not giving up.
